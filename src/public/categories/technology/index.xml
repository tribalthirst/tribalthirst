      <description>Reminder for my basic git aliases in Powershell along with my modules for posh-git and oh-my-posh:

      <title>Engineers:  the challenge of enough documentation</title>
      <link>https://www.tribalthirst.com/posts/engineers-the-challenge-of-enough-documentation/</link>

      <guid>https://www.tribalthirst.com/posts/engineers-the-challenge-of-enough-documentation/</guid>
      <description>The question: In software engineering practices especially in the areas of Scrum, Agile, or XP, what documentation is necessary to build a quality product?
The debate on documentation feels political. Each side of the spectrum is moving farther away from the center and becoming extreme with documentation practices. Snippets and quotes out of context are not useful to justify whether to document or not. Each stance has created a quality gap in the delivery, maintenance, and innovation of systems today.</description>

      <title>Creating a startup work routine that matters</title>

      <description>What is your startup routine?
At 6:40 am on December 23rd, 2021, enough is enough on being overwhelmed in the morning. It is an official holiday at my place of employment, but here I am still pushing out emails, reviewing dashboards, and stressing on the next set of due dates. Why? It is about routines. The explicit work rituals I have set for myself, and the ones where they are set for me.</description>

      <title>Code Review - Is everything in the right place?</title>
      <link>https://www.tribalthirst.com/posts/code-review-is-everything-in-the-right-place/</link>

      <description>Is your foundation in good shape?
One of the often overlooked parts of a code review is checking out the structure of the underneath repository. I refer to this as the &amp;ldquo;bones&amp;rdquo; or skeleton of the program, application, or service. It is often very easy to overlook a file or folder out of place. The subtle organization of files and folders can be beneficial for software engineers in future work.</description>

      <title>Code Review Task 1 - What are the Goals?</title>
      <link>https://www.tribalthirst.com/posts/code-review-task-1-goals/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Code reviews are one of the most important tools that can be used to improve quality and productivity for a development team.  One of the keys to completing a review well is to know what the goals of the review actually are. There are two goals I would ask you to set: Team Goals and Individual Review Goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Anatomy of a Review in 5 Questions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks I am going to give a presentation on doing great code reviews. Here is a piece that I wrote 5 years ago that captured the 5 W&amp;rsquo;s. There are a few changes that I felt were appropriate to make as an update. Most importantly, the guidance below doesn&amp;rsquo;t just apply to code reviews, but any review that you may do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently ran into an issue, where I had to mix environments while developing.  On top of the mixed environments, I was manipulating data. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
