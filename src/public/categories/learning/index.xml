I am grateful as an 8 year Navy veteran, to have served in the military. Those experiences have shaped many parts of my character and informed my values. In this month, where we are recognizing our veterans, please consider the following:

      <title>The Experience Matters</title>

    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I truly was impressed by the density of Hong Kong&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

What? Starbucks didn&amp;rsquo;t open till 8:00am.  How did I survive the mornings until then.  I must say the breakfast sandwiches were much better than the U.S.  The drop of dijon mustard was killer!  Then there was Dim Sum for breakfast.  I did skip the chicken feet (phoenix claws) for that setting.  It was an experience that I will remember for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How we create labels every day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That &lt;em&gt;marketer&lt;/em&gt; will never understand software development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That developer &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t do strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t talk in meetings.  It is just his &lt;em&gt;introvert&lt;/em&gt; nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her skills assessment shows she has a temper.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have found it extremely difficult to get started on projects that I think are daunting.  It gets even worse when I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There is a 5 part podcast series on building your leadership pipeline that I was listening to this morning on the treadmill. The part I was listening to was about the role people fit into the pipeline. It made me think of where I work and I started bucketing traits of participants in the workplace vs. volunteers.
Participants:

      <description>This is nothing new to most individuals, but really hit home to me today as I was looking at some team challenges.
We all have areas where we can develop in. Without help in our developmental area, we have to discover the &amp;ldquo;deep knowledge&amp;rdquo;. This can be painful and arduous at best. Many times the deep knowledge is only for those core areas where we want to be a craftsman. You want those learnings to become a part of you.</description>

      <description>I was really looking forward to a breakfast talk about work and worship in downtown Seattle. The cogs of the work engine were grinding and a pleasant change of pace where I could soak in information was just what I needed. I am glad I wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed. Here are 10 key notes in no particular order from that talk:
