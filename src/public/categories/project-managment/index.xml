      <description>Do you know a leader who says yes to everything? Their team just finished a significant and stressful month to get an &amp;ldquo;urgent&amp;rdquo; marketing experience out the door and the leader agreed to deliver something else urgent on a compressed timeline. Where was the boundary between the finish and start of the next project. It never materialized. Take a more concrete example. Do you ever block time off on your calendar to get work done and people just schedule right over that without any care or thought?</description>

      <description>The death march towards the release date has begun. The email just went out to ask for &amp;ldquo;volunteers&amp;rdquo; to put in a few extra hours this weekend to complete a couple rounds of testing before sending it over the wall for user testing. The project manager is trying to herd cats to get a complete status before the leadership team goes on &amp;ldquo;holiday&amp;rdquo;. The developers are questioning why leadership isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be in on the weekend and what does volunteer mean anyways.</description>
