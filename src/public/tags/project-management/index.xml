      <description>The death march towards the release date has begun. The email just went out to ask for &amp;ldquo;volunteers&amp;rdquo; to put in a few extra hours this weekend to complete a couple rounds of testing before sending it over the wall for user testing. The project manager is trying to herd cats to get a complete status before the leadership team goes on &amp;ldquo;holiday&amp;rdquo;. The developers are questioning why leadership isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be in on the weekend and what does volunteer mean anyways.</description>
