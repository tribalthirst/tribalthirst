<div style="grid-column: 2;font-size: 1.4em;padding:20px;"><p>There is a 5 part podcast series on <a href="https://leadership.lifeway.com/podcast-5lq/">building your leadership pipeline</a> that I was listening to this morning on the treadmill.  The part I was listening to was about the role people fit into the pipeline. It made me think of where I work and I started bucketing traits of participants in the workplace vs. volunteers.</p>
<p>Participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are just there to do the job at hand.  No extra work required.</li>
<li>The paycheck drives the decision making for them.</li>
<li>Participants can also be seen as voyeurs in that outside of the work they are doing, they just watch.  Whether what they see happening is good or bad, they don&rsquo;t care and are not going to jump in to right the ship.</li>
<li>Have a what have you done for me lately attitude.  Participants expect to gain something, usually self-serving.</li>
<li>Participants only grow when they are fed by others and are picky on the nourishment that they are given.</li>
<li>They are passengers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Volunteers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step out of their comfort zone and take on something that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily benefit themselves.</li>
<li>See a bigger picture and are willing to risk being part of it.</li>
<li>Care deeply about doing work that may only be to server others as it is part of a passion or grander plan.</li>
<li>Volunteering shows leadership.</li>
<li>Volunteers grow by feeding themselves.  They search out the nourishment that enriches their career.</li>
<li>They are in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to be a volunteer wherever I can.  As a leader, I appreciate volunteers, because they are stepping out for a greater purpose.</p>
