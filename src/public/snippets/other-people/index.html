<blockquote>
<p>Those who never read the Bible will read our lives, so it is by doing good that we put to silence the ignorance of foolish men - David Guzik (<a href="https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/guz/1-peter-2.html">1 Peter 2 Commentary</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I heard this quote in Sunday&rsquo;s sermon and spent some time in introspection.  Working with teams, coaching and mentoring, I often talk about the value of introspection.  As Christians, this is a habit that we must cultivate for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>People see how we behave every day.  We are representatives of the Kingdom.  If we live &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; and &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; lives, the witness does not match our faith.  Remember one day ordinary will be eternity in heaven worshipping our Lord.</li>
<li>I look backwards to understand how I can create opportunities to share Christ&rsquo;s love through me going forward.</li>
<li>As Christians, if we are growing, we are changing.  Change brings about character through perseverance, especially during struggles.  Look back on the struggle and share the lessons of maturing in Christ.</li>
<li>Are you lukewarm? Who would people rather hang around with, the milk toast or the magnet. Christians are a <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A9&amp;version=KJV">peculiar people</a>.  I have gone from being a person might only give a passing comment so as not to be looked at funny to being a fan of my Master interjecting the good news intentionally in my actions.  I am finding that the differing attitudes, principles, and foundation in Christ draws people near.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am excited to see other people now looking at me differently.  I am not ashamed of being gracious, loving, caring, humble, meek and having a servant&rsquo;s heart.  The perception is changing and it is on the right path.  My hope is that people see Christ in me so that they can also establish an eternal relationship.</p>
