<li>We all have areas where we can develop in.</li>
<li>Without help in our developmental area, we have to discover the &ldquo;deep knowledge&rdquo;.  This can be painful and arduous at best.</li>
<li>Many times the deep knowledge is only for those core areas where we want to be a craftsman.  You want those learnings to become a part of you.</li>
<li>When working on an area to develop, keep in mind &ldquo;there is nothing new under the sun.&rdquo;  You should leverage the foundations that others have sweated over, poured their heart into, and shared with the world.</li>
<li>Share the learnings of what you are developing so others can benefit.</li>
<li>It may be that you should &ldquo;outsource&rdquo; the item(s) you are trying to gain knowledge about.  It may not be the best use of your time.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will work to develop my strengths in a practical manner that is to the benefit of those around me.</p>
