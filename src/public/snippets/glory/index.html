<div style="grid-column: 2;font-size: 1.4em;padding:20px;"><p>As part of my <a href="https://www.bsfinternational.org/">BSF</a> study, the following question was presented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean to give glory, honor, and thanks to God, and how are you doing so? (See 1 Chronicles 29:11-13); Romans 12:1-2; Colossians 3:16-17).</p>

<p>I came up with a couple of key words here:  Recognize and Action</p>
<h2 id="recognize">Recognize</h2>
<p>We must understand that everything is God&rsquo;s and under His control. He provides the power and the riches and the honour of our lives. It seems obvious, but how many times do we try to take control of our lives and of those around us?  It is a limitation of our thinking and our sinful nature that we don&rsquo;t include the most powerful, most generous and most honorable presence in every decision we make.</p>
<h2 id="action">Action</h2>
<p>We must put into practice the act of including God in our decisions. In Romans 12:2 we are asked to prove what is the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God. Who do we need to prove it to?  First ourselves, and then to others.  God has nothing to prove to us. Our actions should establish the truth and genuine nature of God. We are called to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, so anything we do is an action that includes God.</p>
<p>May this be a blessing to you.  This month I am creating a series on <a href="https://www.tribalthirst.com/categories/intentional-living/">Intentional Living</a>. Please join in the conversation.</p>
