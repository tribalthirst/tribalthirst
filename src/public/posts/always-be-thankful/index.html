<p>Today may have special significance, but all throughout our days we have so much to be thankful for. True thankfulness is a heart action, it evolves from your Spirit and manifests in forms of a smile, gratitude, encouragement, and an amazing attitude.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-have-a-thankful-attitude">How I have a thankful attitude</h2>
<ul>
<li>It starts with thanking God each and every morning that I am breathing. His mercies are new every day.</li>
<li>I Focus on the positive. There is no better way than to tally up all the good things that are happening and being thankful for them</li>
<li>I help others. By giving of myself, I find that I receive such a blessing from their smiles and uplifted countenance. I like to do this in abundance.</li>
<li>When I feel it is hard to be thankful, I take a step back to think about all sides of a situation and am thankful for the opposite point of view.</li>
<li>I reflect on my current situation. It is never the worst it can be. I am thankful for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Thanksgiving, I want to say thanks to everyone who makes me the person I am today.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am especially grateful that my family is intentional about loving me and investing their time to make our family awesome.</li>
<li>I am thankful for those I work with, as they are molding me to be the co-worker and leader that is pleasing to God.</li>
<li>I am blessed to know friends who spread thanksgiving freely.</li>
<li>I am calling out my wife in particular, who I am eternally thankful for being part of my life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
