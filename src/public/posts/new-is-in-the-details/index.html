<p>The true meaning of these verses is what is not said.  Not everything is unchanging.  It is in these margins that we can find imagination, creativity, and joy.  For instance, the sun rises every day, but there is a new masterpiece when it rises in the sky every morning that is not always the same.  Clouds create new colors, streams of light, temperature changes, etc.  This is all God&rsquo;s design.</p>
<p>While God grants us breath, we rise every morning also.  Each day is a new day for that masterpiece to be created.  Each day is a chance to engage with God to create a daily masterpiece.  This is where we sometimes miss the point of &ldquo;nothing new under the sun.&rdquo;  The majority of what we do may be the daily routine.  However, with God in control, the nuances of that daily routine will bring His craftmanship in to build a masterpiece.</p>
<p>It is easy to look at the patterns in our life and become weary.  We don&rsquo;t always see the fine details that occur as we plod along.  Our brain is wired to do unconscious things over and over.  So when we ask the question &ldquo;Is this all my life is about?&rdquo; reflect on who is in control,God or ourselves.More importantly, we need to look and see what God&rsquo;s creativity and imagination has led me to not just in the moment, but over time.  That is a wonder.</p>
