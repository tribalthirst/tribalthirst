Wouldn&rsquo;t be nice if all you had to say was &ldquo;Focus&rdquo; and everything just fell into place for the rest of the day?  Do you feel that your day spins out of control as you get randomized?  If you stray from a normal routine, do you frequently feel that something was missed?  I have seen that great focus leads to great results.</p>
<h2 id="short-term-focus">Short Term Focus</h2>
<p>Yesterday was a totally randomizing day, constant interruptions combined with a lack of resolve to &ldquo;start&rdquo; anything that wouldn&rsquo;t result in completion.  I know that if I had 30 uninterrupted minutes to work on 1 task, it would have been knocked out and there would be a sense of accomplishment.  This type of short term focus is very intense.  It requires no distractions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you know the end goal of the short term task.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have everything you need to accomplish the task at hand before starting.</li>
<li>Allocate time to get &ldquo;into the zone&rdquo; and &ldquo;reflect&rdquo;.  Jumping right into a focused task can sometimes lead to disaster because you are still thinking about the previous work.</li>
<li>I have used a Pomodoro timer to help me out.  My son sets the timer on the microwave for his reading and I have seen great focus in that realm.  It is OK to continue on if you are staying focused.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I do development, my most enjoyable work is when the goal is known and the task is fully completed.  There will be times when I tune out the world around me and just focus on that.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-focus">Long Term Focus</h2>
<p>I had the opportunity to work with some very smart people who were envisioning what Space would look like in 25 years.  They developed a long range plan that would act as that guide.  I have to say that when I look back, it is amazing how accurate that plan was.  That was because the focus was on the plan.  We often hear in the workplace a concept of focusing on the North Star.  As you probably know, sailor&rsquo;s used the North Star as a way to navigate.  Having long term focus is the ability to navigate to complete a goal that is out of reach at that particular time.</p>
<ul>
<li>First you must have a goal to focus on.</li>
<li>Focus takes prioritization.  You will have to make hard choices in order to meet that goal.</li>
<li>When you go off track and you will, how do you get realigned?  Make short term focus points to get back to the direction you want to go.</li>
<li>Pick your head up from the short term once in a while.  Try walking 100 yards with your head down.  Most likely you will miss your end destination.</li>
</ul>
