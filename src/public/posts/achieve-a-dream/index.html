<p>Many dreams fall short of where they could be because they are pursued as a team of one. There is only so far one can get on talent alone. Soon the roadblocks are upon you. You have only a limited amount of capacity. There is no one to turn to for advice on a hard question or problem. Eventually you become overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The good news? Teams can come to the rescue. But first you have to build one.</p>
<h2 id="4-ways-to-build-a-dream-team">4 ways to build a dream team</h2>
<p>There are several factors that are involved with building a team. Here are four that I believe you must do to get a team onboard to accomplish the dream set before you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share your dream with others. This is one of the most powerful ways to begin building your team.  When you share, other people are informed and will:
<ul>
<li>Jump on board to participate with you in some capacity.</li>
<li>Connect you to others that they know who might help in achieving your dream.</li>
<li>Be a sounding board for your dream. Dreams are big, they require input to fuel direction and momentum. People are usually willing to share their opinions. I call this mining for information gold. So let them talk and listen carefully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seek out people who have different strengths than you. We can&rsquo;t do everything. We only do a few things well. Ask people to be on your team that have strengths that are different than yours.</li>
<li>Only bring on members that are going to invest. This may seem obvious, however, a lot of times we bring on people who become dead weight or a hindrance to achieving our dream on teams. Your dream will only go as far as your weakest link.</li>
<li>Invest in your team. Figure out what their dreams are and pour into those also. By knowing their aspirations, you will gain empathy, celebrate successes, and learn abundantly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting your dream going requires more than yourself. Teams exponentially help you progress in your dream. Rely on others and build a team that can take your dream farther. What are you waiting for?</p>
