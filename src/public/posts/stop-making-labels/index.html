<ul>
<li>That <em>marketer</em> will never understand software development</li>
<li>That developer <em>doesn&rsquo;t do strategy</em></li>
<li>He doesn&rsquo;t talk in meetings.  It is just his <em>introvert</em> nature.</li>

</ul>
<p>I was very convicted when I was listening to this podcast yesterday.  I realize that I label people all the time, not intentionally, but I do it just the same.   The key that I got out of the message was that every time we place a label on someone, we restrict their ability to contribute and maximize their potential.  My exercise today is to figure out what labels I am applying.  Consciously I am going to write these down and see where I could change my communication style to open up and contribute to potential maximization.</p>
<h2 id="where-labels-come-from">Where labels come from</h2>
<p>I also took the opportunity to figure out the labels others have given me.  This inventory is helping me to see where I am stifling opportunity because of the label. Here are some of the places I reflected on:</p>
<ul>
<li>My family and children give me labels
<ul>
<li>One of those is a hard worker.  I need to be careful that label is not the primary way I am viewed.  I have used this label as a crutch in the past.</li>
<li>Sacrificial - Again while this can be good for most of the time, I shouldn&rsquo;t use it as a badge of honor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My coworkers have provided me labels, some good, some not so good.
<ul>
<li>Competency minded - Several times I have had colleagues evaluate my interactions and this was a recurring theme.  I will need to be aware that competency is only one trait</li>
<li>Single Point of Failure - This is such an unnerving label.  I constantly strive to share because of this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Labels I give myself
<ul>
<li>Unorganized - I am always trying to increase my productivity and make sure that I have all the answers beforehand.  Sometimes I spend too much energy</li>
<li>Servant Leadership - I need to make sure that I don&rsquo;t mask unhealthy behaviors such as pride behind this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-labels-restrict-opportunity">How labels restrict opportunity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Labels provide specificity that may be unwarranted.  If someone labels you as a marketer for instance, they may only consult you when it is a marketing question.  However, your experiential skills may provide unique insights.</li>
<li>Labels are defined by the person labeling you.  People utilize labels as just a quick way to categorize according to their needs.  Again, be aware that you can label yourself and just fall into the categories.</li>
<li>Labels create bias.  For instance, we see this in politics.  Most people are not just Democrat or Republican, however, they restrict their thinking by making compromises they fundamentally don&rsquo;t believe in just because of choosing a &ldquo;label&rdquo; party platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>What labels do you use or see.</p>
