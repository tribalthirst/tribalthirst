<div style="grid-column: 2;font-size: 1.2em;padding:20px;"><p>At four o&rsquo;clock in the morning the world around me sounds very different than 9am. i appreciate the stillness.</p>
<p>However, I am often shocked when I concentrate on the sounds even at that time. How did I ever miss the frog croaking or the neighbor&rsquo;s water fountain gurgle. Every time I go outside the sounds are there, but coverd up by all the other noise.</p>
<p>How much do we block out parts of our environment instinctively. The sound of a fan pushing air on a warm day just fades in the background. We now have a wonderful tool called noise cancelling heaphones. Sometimes, I call it selective hearing when I hear a shout for some help reverberating in the house.</p>
<p>I found a chart that compared <a href="https://keydifferences.com/difference-between-hearing-and-listening.html#ComparisonChart">hearing vs. listening</a> which I thought was a reasonable breakdown of the differences. Put simply for me, I think of listening as an active measure that has an outcome, where hearing is passive and in the background.</p>
<h3 id="a-call-to-listen-did-you-hear-me">A call to listen, did you hear me?</h3>
<p>I looked back on several posts I have written and quite a few talk about listening well. With all the noise that the world is generating, I believe our focus on listening is ever so important. Listening well will increase our empathy, guide our grace, and evolve our love for others. So the next time you get a chance to listen to people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t speak, even in your head. It is easy to start the rebuttal process isn&rsquo;t it. Also, most times listening is all that is needed, not an answer to fix what the other person is telling you.</li>
<li>Assume the best intentions. What you hear might not align with your beliefs, but what you listen to may be the cry for support and consolation of a deeper issue.</li>
<li>Gain understanding. Listening will always provide a nugget of learning, even if it is a disagreement on what is being said. Your views evolve from listening.</li>
