As I am studying great leadership, I find that most have learned how to overcome being anxious.  Their outward appearance is one of a calm demeanor, they have a steady hand, and command with ease the most difficult situations.   Being a former military person, I saw how well officers would make decisions with determination, even though lives may have been at stake.  Nehemiah always comes to mind as a leader who didn&rsquo;t worry, but sought God&rsquo;s council in his decision making and charged ahead. Here are a couple of ways that leaders overcome that sense of worry.</p>
<h2 id="leaders-have-a-clear-destination">Leaders have a clear destination</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know where you are headed, how do you know when you get there?  Or if you are even headed in the right direction.  Confusion ensues, and triggers nervousness, worry, and questioning of ones decisions. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+2%3A17&amp;version=NIV">Nehemiah was confident in sharing vision and bringing people along</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write down where you want to end up so you have that north star.</li>
<li>Tell others where you are going so you can be held accountable.  Better yet, take them on the journey with you.</li>
<li>Take small steps that move you forward so you won&rsquo;t be overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leaders-seek-wise-council">Leaders seek wise council</h2>
<p>Anxiousness diminishes when you do not lean on your own understanding.  Leaders find wise council by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building relationships with other leaders</li>
<li>Creating mastermind groups</li>
<li>Executive coaching</li>
<li>Hiring great people around them that aren&rsquo;t just yes men</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, worry, concern, and an anxious heart can be overcome.  Christians can take heart from the following verse which gives us prescriptive guidance on conquering this ailment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  (Philippians 4:6-7)</p>
</blockquote>
