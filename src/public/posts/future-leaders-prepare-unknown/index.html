<blockquote>
<p>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit”— yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does not mean that we should just sit around idly by and let the future pass us by.  Great leaders recognize that our days our numbered and that the work they have to do is great.  For the future, they commit to a plan, a goal, or a vision.</p>
<h2 id="clarity-to-plan">Clarity to plan</h2>
<p>The bible is filled with many verses directing us on how to plan for the future, even if we don&rsquo;t know it yet.  Leadership will do well to plan and execute in the midst of uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proverbs 16:3 - Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.</li>
<li>Proverbs 6:6-8 - Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise. Without having any chief, officer, or ruler, she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.</li>
<li>Isaiah 32:8 - But he who is noble plans noble things, and on noble things he stands.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="seeking-wise-council">Seeking wise council</h2>
<p>The future is out in front.  It is up to leaders to make great decisions to move people and generations toward it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proverbs 11:14 - Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.</li>
<li>Proverbs 15:22 - Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed.</li>
<li>Psalm 90:12 - So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds for me tomorrow.  However, I will listen to our Lord and put in place plans with good council.  Finally, I will execute those plans with God in control.</p>
