<p>I am often asked to provide charts of data, tables of information, and bullet point lists though the week. I just put together a basic bar chart in Excel (Select your table and hit the F11 key) a few hours ago. Today&rsquo;s topic in communication is making sure that the data meets the context of how it is being used.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, most people can manipulate facts to serve whatever message they are trying to get across. I am not suggesting that this is either good or bad. You may have heard the saying &ldquo;Let the facts speak for themselves&rdquo;. I would like to change this up a bit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Facts must have a narrator to tell the proper story&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tips-in-communicating-facts-correctly">Tips in communicating facts correctly</h2>
<ol>
<li>Displaying the Top X should always have a total associated with it. We see the top 10 lists all the time, however, most of us never even question &ldquo;Top X of what?&rdquo; Is it the top 5 of 100? Or the top 5 of 6? By displaying the total helps users to have a better framing for what they are reading.</li>
<li>With percentages and surveys show the sample size. Whenever I see a percentage in a slide my first thought is to figure out what is it based on. Is it .5% of 1,000,000 or 95% of 1,000? Which is affecting more people? This is really a big deal for me when I see numbers that affect customers.</li>
<li>Make your bullet points stand on their own. Ensure if you are using bullets to present information to be concise, but have enough information to either:
<ul>
<li>Take an action: Deliver one .pdf and one .pptx by January 31st</li>
<li>State a fact: 5 Bugs were logged in the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Table information should include source data references. Many times we deliver a subset of data for reports, business reviews, or as a way to compare items. It is important to show where the sources of the data come from. Many times if I am using the data in a slide deck, I like to provide the details in the notes section so I can refer to it when needed.</li>
