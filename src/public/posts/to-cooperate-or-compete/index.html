<p>We are taught from a young age how to cooperate with others to create a more harmonious environment. We are also taught how to compete with the premise that it will make us better human beings. Cooperation is a behavior that benefits others through working together to achieve something greater. Competition builds the character of an individual for self-growth and gain.Each one used in the proper balance, these behaviors are core to achieving most goals or outcomes in life. However, if I had one skill I could master it would be cooperation. Here is why:</p>
<h2 id="teams-cooperate-before-competing">Teams cooperate before competing</h2>
<p>The fundamental definition of a team is a group that works together to achieve something greater than they can do individually. There is no situation in our lives, where cooperation is not involved. However, I do not have to ever compete and can still accomplish greatness with a team. They do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing ideas. Adding ideas breeds innovation and creative ways to solve a problem.</li>
<li>Standing on the shoulders of others before them. Great teams seek to utilize the talents of each person.</li>
<li>Serving to make the team better. The value gained is exponential because everyone is benefiting by everyone else.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cooperation-is-a-heart-behavior">Cooperation is a heart behavior</h2>
<p>The behavior of cooperation is focused upon the outcomes of others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Others have a part to play and you may be made vulnerable.</li>
<li>It takes a kind spirit to cooperate when others don&rsquo;t want to</li>
<li>It takes empathy to understand differing opinions when cooperating</li>
<li>There is great joy when others succeed while cooperating.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am always encouraged more when I cooperate first. It puts my mind and soul at ease. Zig Ziglar has a great quote about the benefit of cooperating with others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help enough other people get what they want.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zig Ziglar</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In what ways do you find cooperation more valuable than competition?</p>
