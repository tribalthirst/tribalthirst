<p>My wife is a master at creating memories for others that people enjoy. She puts a lot of effort into making sure that the details are subtle but will evoke a great experience. This weekend it was about a birthday celebration for my daughter that lasted the whole day, experienced at first with her family, then her bible study group, then a cap off of karaoke and dinner with her friends. On Facebook, she posted that it was her best birthday ever.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-creating-memories">The value of creating memories</h2>
<p>When we create memories for others, we are benefiting ourselves as well as the people involved. Here are some thoughts about being a memory craftsman:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memories don&rsquo;t have to be extravagant. The can be created for paying attention to the little details in life. They can be created with a smile or a kind word.</li>
<li>Intentionally seek out opportunities to create a great memory.</li>
<li>Develop shared experiences where you can be part of the memory also.</li>
<li>Memories can be planned out. Focus on traditions, or consistent repetitive moments</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-memory-creation-techniques">Some memory creation techniques</h2>
<ul>
<li>Smile a lot.</li>
<li>Recognize a person by name.</li>
<li>Plan with those you want to share the memory with.</li>
<li>Make big moments simple.</li>
<li>Deliver quality over quantity.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am blessed to have a new memorable moment each and every day from others around me. See the opportunity and seize the time to be a memory maker.</p>
