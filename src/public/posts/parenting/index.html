<div style="grid-column: 2;font-size: 1.2em;padding:20px;"><p>Over the last couple of weeks, I have been examining how I have been parenting. I have been watching what others say about how they are parenting.</p>
<p>I am seeing others begin their parenting journey. I am reflecting on how my mother and father have raised me.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>I was inspired by late nights of a camping trip, where my son said &ldquo;The best time of the trip was reading to his parents.&rdquo; I was inspired to hear that a new co-worker stated that his time with his children is the priority. I was inspired by the announcement of another co-workers firstborn which was well thought out, humorous, and loving. I was inspired by a couple of late night conversations at the couch of my father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>
<p>Parenting is a journey. I realize that I have been very haphazard in that approach. I didn&rsquo;t really even ask how to be a better father. Sure, I gleaned information here or there. I picked up some warning signs. I learned from my experience as a child. I continuously learn from my mistakes in raising my children today.</p>
<p>My advice: Seek council. Seek understanding. Be wise with your children.</p>
<p>I have had a master reference in my life that I have all but ignored for a long while when it comes to being a parent. Personally, I am looking at my loving Father as my guide to being a better father. Even if you don&rsquo;t share my beliefs, read some of the great stories and wisdom in the Bible. You will be amazed at the practicality and insights you can receive. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>John 3:16 - God saves the world through his son. You may say wait, He allowed his son to die. While that is true, God gives the world a chance for salvation if they just understand the love that it took for this to happen. This is why those that believe are called sons and daughters of God.</li>
<li>2 Samuel 13-18 - David&rsquo;s love for his son Absalom. It is truly a lesson that shows the love a father had for his son. Many people would say that as a parent, it is this type of moment that they dread. A time when the child is in rebellion with their parents.</li>
<li>Proverbs - Lessons on wisdom. Teach a child in the way they should go. Proverbs records life truths that we can impart to our children. I wish that I had started earlier understanding the importance of transferring wisdom to my children. Thank you dad in those moments where I glean that wisdom.</li>
