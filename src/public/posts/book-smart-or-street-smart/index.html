<p>Solomon soaked up all the nuances of learning.  Perhaps he was the first professional &ldquo;student&rdquo;.  I often work with people who are &ldquo;book smart&rdquo; but not &ldquo;street smart&rdquo;.  This is kind of how I think about Solomon and reflect about many things in my life:</p>
<p>The book smart person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spouts streams of knowledge without application</li>
<li>Argues over the nuances and lets the main point get away</li>
<li>Always has to speak and seldom listens</li>
<li>All is vanity</li>
</ul>
<p>The street smart person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practically applies what they learn</li>
<li>Has a focus on the important need at the time</li>
<li>Listens carefully and makes decisions based upon multiple inputs</li>
<li>Knowledge is about survival</li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate wisdom I am starting to understand is one where my life is ordered by God&rsquo;s direction.  Every question, action, and thought is put through the filter of God&rsquo;s will and what comes out is made pure.  My goal then is not to pollute or dilute  the end result, rather trust and obey.</p>
