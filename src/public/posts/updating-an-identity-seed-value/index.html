<div style="grid-column: 2;font-size: 1.2em;padding:20px;"><p>I recently ran into an issue, where I had to mix environments while developing.  On top of the mixed environments, I was manipulating data. </p>
<p>I had a few choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an exact replica of the production data and an environment that I didn&rsquo;t manage or maintain.  (Approximately 6 hours)</li>
<li>Do some mocking of the data that I was going to be updating.  (Didn&rsquo;t fully understand the black box well enough to know what happens to the data once it has been sent)</li>
<li>Work on entirely new records that I could then later delete if needed from both systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>In choosing the third option, I went to work.  I still wanted to be extra careful as I was manipulating a production environment as part of my testing (for those interested, I was passing data back and forth between a CRM system and a website).  I created my first record on the website and set forth to add it to the CRM.  I got an error message stating the record already exists!!!  How could this be possible.  It so happens that the production website had already added records where I was matching against the identity value.  It only took me about an hour to stare dumbfounded at the code, thinking I was doing something tragically wrong.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to have a race condition between production and staging, so I remembered that you could set an Identity field to start at a certain number.  I asked myself if it was possible to do this after the initial table setup and it is.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2007/03/15/sql-server-dbcc-reseed-table-identity-value-reset-table-identity/">http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2007/03/15/sql-server-dbcc-reseed-table-identity-value-reset-table-identity/</a></p>
<p>DBCC CHECKIDENT (yourtable, reseed, 34)</p>
<p>I thought of a couple of other uses for this statement also:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are changing to a major upgrade of certain tables, it might come in handy for just a numeric separation.</li>
<li>Resetting the identity you were bulk deleting/adding/shuffling around information.</li>
</ul>
<p>What would you use this for?  It was about 10 minutes of research and 5 seconds of execution.  I would say it was a timesaver for me.</p></div>
