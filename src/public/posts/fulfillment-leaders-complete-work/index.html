<div style="grid-column: 2;font-size: 1.2em;padding:20px;"><p>I have now been working about 6 hours today.  I wish I could say it is for enjoyment, but rather I am trying to fulfill a work commitment.  Sometimes it takes extra effort, persevering through frustration, or just time to complete.  Fulfillment is that finality of completion, the realization of a achieving a goal, or getting to the end.  Leaders take fulfillment very seriously, both for themselves and their subordinates.  In order to complete work, here are two key leadership behaviors:</p>
<h2 id="delegation">Delegation</h2>
<p>One of the most effective ways that work gets accomplished is through delegation.  This is the way for a leader to scale their output and work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus delegated spreading the Gospel to his followers (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10&amp;version=ESV">Matthew 10:5-16</a>)</li>
<li>Paul entrusts those that hear the Gospel to teach others (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+2%3A2&amp;version=ESV">2 Timothy 2:2</a>)</li>
<li>Moses used delegation for passing judgement so that he could spend time to others (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+18%3A13-26&amp;version=ESV">Exodus 18:13-26</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="decision-making">Decision Making</h2>
<p>When leaders are truly committed to fulfilling goals, projects, or solving problems, they aren&rsquo;t afraid to make or withhold a decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaders make decisions to move things forward, but not at the expense of compromising values or principles</li>
<li>Leaders withhold decisions to allow buy-in for others who will do the majority of the work</li>
<li>Leaders make decisions where they shoulder the burden, relieving pressure on others getting the work done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fulfillment is about completing work.  I like this word, because it speaks to the finality and fullness of a job well done.  Leaders respect and honor fulfillment from others and expect it of themselves.</p>
