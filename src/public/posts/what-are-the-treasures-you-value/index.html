<h2 id="my-personal-treasures">My Personal Treasures</h2>
<ul>
<li>Family. I consider my family a treasure that the Lord has given to me which is precious and that I want to care for diligently. My family is growing up, my children are becoming independent.  I cherish walks with my wife.  I couldn&rsquo;t have said that 10 years ago.  This is because I am investing in the relationship, and seeing the fruits of that investment.</li>
<li>Knowledge and learning are other treasures as long as I can give them away.  What good does it do me if I learn but don&rsquo;t share.  I am now starting to see mentoring opportunities everywhere.  Solomon, the wisest man, became that way because he asked for it.</li>
<li>Doing for others just to see a smile, a hint of gratitude, or smidge of happiness. The more I live by example in humility, letting God be in control, and letting go, the more I will let His light shine for others to find the way. These are the riches on earth that everyone can get a hold of.</li>
</ul>
<p>We only have so many days allotted to us. I don&rsquo;t know when that number starts to take a serious meaning, it is different for everyone. Our mortality in this life is a reminder that we need to spend each day focused on eternity and the gift of love and life that Jesus has bestowed on each of us.</p>
