Don&rsquo;t ever think that you are just talking to a single person over Skype, Lync, or other online meeting communications and that the conversation is private. As a matter of fact don&rsquo;t even think that an email is private. I am doing a lot of reflecting on this today, as I participated as a listener in a call without being announced. My conscience bothered me all night and honestly, I didn&rsquo;t measure up to the ethics and morals that I strongly believe in.">

<p>Don&rsquo;t ever think that you are just talking to a single person over Skype, Lync, or other online meeting communications and that the conversation is private.  As a matter of fact don&rsquo;t even think that an email is private.  I am doing a lot of reflecting on this today, as I participated as a listener in a call  without being announced.  My conscience bothered me all night and honestly, I didn&rsquo;t measure up to the ethics and morals that I strongly believe in.  Here is some of the damage that listening in did for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>I failed myself.</li>
<li>I deceived others.</li>
<li>I intruded on a conversation about me that others thought they had the freedom to share openly.  This also reminded me that I can&rsquo;t rely on honest feedback.</li>
<li>It eroded trust that I have for people and eventually people have for me.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have asked to not ever be put in that position again.  In addition, I know that I have some relationship building to do with those I listened in on.  This is hard, because they don&rsquo;t know it.  I apologize</p>
