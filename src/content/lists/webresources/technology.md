Most of my technology content here is from the Microsoft stack.  I do find that most of the blogs, however, focus on the higher order abstraction of designs, strategy, and key insights in the software engineering space.  I may mix in other content, such as articles and podcasts.  I will keep updating every so often and share out as appropriate.
