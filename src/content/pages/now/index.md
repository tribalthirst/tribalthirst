## At this moment
I just finished watering a plant where we got our hummingbirds in the vacinity coming to.  Don't let the plant die.

## Recent stuff
Came off a 10 day cruise where I got to spend time with my family.  It was an enjoyable time and we even sent my son to stay with his sister in Hong Kong for a couple of months.

Back at work, cooking more dinners at home, and enjoying trying to be more relaxed.

## Books and more
Reading a three book set by Francis Chan. Appreciate some of the simplicity and straight forward nature that he challenges us.

Created some Power Automates that do a custom "RSS" collection for me to peruse.  Found Creative Mornings content.  That is a win.
