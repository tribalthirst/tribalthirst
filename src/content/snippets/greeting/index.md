How is your soul?

The concept of good morning doesn't cut it anymore.  I want to start my interactions with people on a more personal level.  "What's up?" and "How's it going?" are just so superficial.  I am not waiting around to actively listen to their answer which has been conditioned to "Fine", "Ok", or "Great!".  But who should I connect with this way?  Would it be appropriate at work?  The rhetorical question is now "If I can't a person with a question like this, what must I do to build up that relationship to experience the joy of sharing life with others?"
