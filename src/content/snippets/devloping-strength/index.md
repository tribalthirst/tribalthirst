This is nothing new to most individuals, but really hit home to me today as I was looking at some team challenges.

1. We all have areas where we can develop in.
2. Without help in our developmental area, we have to discover the "deep knowledge".  This can be painful and arduous at best.
3. Many times the deep knowledge is only for those core areas where we want to be a craftsman.  You want those learnings to become a part of you.
4. When working on an area to develop, keep in mind "there is nothing new under the sun."  You should leverage the foundations that others have sweated over, poured their heart into, and shared with the world.
5. Share the learnings of what you are developing so others can benefit.
6. It may be that you should "outsource" the item(s) you are trying to gain knowledge about.  It may not be the best use of your time.

I will work to develop my strengths in a practical manner that is to the benefit of those around me.
