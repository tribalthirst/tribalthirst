> George Washington (to Hamilton): ... Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder.

I would like to rephrase this a little.  

> Execution is easy, planning is harder - by Me

This is an opinion, but I think overall it stands up to most litmus tests for the following reasons:
* There be dragons.  It is easy to get stuck in developing the plan, because of the unknowns
* There be opinions.  10 engineers = 10 different ways to think about the plan. 
* There be constraints.  The iron triangle = time, people, and money.  Plans change based upon the quantities of these.
* There be politicians.  Organizations are fraught with closed door deals.  Wouldn't it be nice if we can be "in the room where it happens"
