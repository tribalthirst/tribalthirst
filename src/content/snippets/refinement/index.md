In the book of [Proverbs](https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/PRO.27.21) the refining of who we are is compared to how silver and gold are purified.  Every time I hit these verses in my morning readings, I reflect on how I am being refined.

This may seem obvious, but in every area of our life we can improve.  For most of us, increasing in value and excellence is a desired outcome for our character, integrity, and well-being. Refinement processes help to separate that which is undesirable from that which is cherished. From the fuel we consume to our character development, change is needed for the next level.

## Intentionally seeking to refine

### At Work
* Find the process to improve that adds value to others
* Network with those that are in positions where you want to be in a year, two years, or at the peak of your career
* Get feedback constantly.  Be proactive and seek from those that will be honest, transparent, and don't sugar coat.  

### From a personal perspective
* Get your mastermind group together.  Make it consistent, relevant, and meaningful.  Don't accept mediocrity of half commitments. I must admit this is one area I need a lot of growth in.
* Reflect on your relationships.  Do you have a list of places where you could be a better friend, spouse, or parent?  How can you refine, if you don't know what should be removed and/or clean?  There is a quote in some circles "you are the average of the 5 people you are around the most".  If that is the case, what actions might you take?
* Seek different perspectives for understanding. As you learn, your points of view get shaped and evolve.

I have a lot of refining to do.
