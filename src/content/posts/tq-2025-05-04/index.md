May the 4th be with you!  As I sit in a coffee shop across from my wife, I am struck at just how much fun it is to read, learn, and make micro changes to processes.  It is also very funny that a micro change isn't easy in code / no code solutions!  A simple anchor tag change cost me 30 minutes of fiddling with Power Automate.  Go Figure

 I can relate to the news today being more negative than positive. As a person of faith, it resonates with me to spend more time in the Scriptures than I spend on news. That is something worth considering if you haven't done that. 

 There is a hashtag #3goodthings on Mastodon which fills my feed mostly.  I so appreciate those in the mornings over negative news.

 I don't relly think much about not UI based interfaces when it comes to Accessibility. This gives me something to think about.

 Optimization for accessiblity is hard.  It is even harder when we are automating for UX and don't have the appropriate data.  Maybe a new micro improvement is in the works.

### Author: Derek Comartin

 The mention of DTOs, POJOs, POCOs, etc. is enough to get my anxiety up. Mappers and the various approaches compound this problem all for the sake of "Simplicity by Abstraction". I appreciate the way Derek talks about DTOs in this video and article.

 Not mentioned in this article when people try to use DTOs across all boundaries in the stack.

 I have conversations around Primitive Obsession with Engineers at least once a month. Even though it looks like the blog here hasn't had a great post in a while, there is so much content with value. Don't just check out the article but also dig in. You won't be disappointed.
