There are few things more enjoyable than looking back on a specific memory in your life. The one I remember most vividly is when my brother and I would go out and play golf with our grandfather. We rarely swung a club, but were rather foragers in the rough and creeks for lost golf balls. I remember the tin cup my grandfather would break out that we would dip into the creek and the sour ball candy we would get on the third and sixth holes.

My wife is a master at creating memories for others that people enjoy. She puts a lot of effort into making sure that the details are subtle but will evoke a great experience. This weekend it was about a birthday celebration for my daughter that lasted the whole day, experienced at first with her family, then her bible study group, then a cap off of karaoke and dinner with her friends. On Facebook, she posted that it was her best birthday ever.

## The value of creating memories

When we create memories for others, we are benefiting ourselves as well as the people involved. Here are some thoughts about being a memory craftsman:

- Memories don't have to be extravagant. The can be created for paying attention to the little details in life. They can be created with a smile or a kind word.
- Intentionally seek out opportunities to create a great memory.
- Develop shared experiences where you can be part of the memory also.
- Memories can be planned out. Focus on traditions, or consistent repetitive moments

## Some memory creation techniques

- Smile a lot.
- Recognize a person by name.
- Plan with those you want to share the memory with.
- Make big moments simple.
- Deliver quality over quantity.

I am blessed to have a new memorable moment each and every day from others around me. See the opportunity and seize the time to be a memory maker.
