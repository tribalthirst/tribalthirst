There is no right or wrong way to start. Just understand that it isn't an overnight process to see the fruits of a teams labor, especially when pursuing a vision that is driven by changes in culture of teams.  Here are some suggestions to get the juices flowing:

1. Start small and maybe focus on one part at a time. Maybe communication is the first area you could get quick wins.  Find ways to improve you communications that are simple, repeatable, and are seen as value.  This could involve producing communictions that highlight accomplishments your team is already doing and expanding the audience.  

2. Bring PLACES into conversations consistently.  Maybe it is a review in your staff meetings or a signature in your email. Ask your team, where they showed actions that are aligned to PLACES in their day to day experiences.  Capture them and write them down.  

3. Make PLACES visible.  Create materials that contain the definition.  Run your decisions through the lens of the attributes to ensure that you are staying in focus with the vision that PLACES helps create.

## It's All About Culture
Each attribute of PLACES will affect your culture, either positively or negatively.  A well rounded team or organization is only as good as the values that shapes it.  By adopting PLACES, change is sure to happen.  There is also a compounding affect as each item in the framework is compatible with the others, creating a solid foundation to grow teams.
