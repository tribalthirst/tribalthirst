Strategic planning in technology leadership is not just a matter of metrics and milestones—it is a spiritual discipline. This article explores five essential roles in strategic planning, each illuminated by Scripture, enriched by commentary, and grounded in pastoral wisdom from respected Christian leaders.

## 1. Vision Setters: Defining Direction and Purpose

Vision setting asks, "Where are we headed?" It aligns every action with the mission and values of the organization. Matthew Henry wrote *"Where there is no revelation of God's will, people run wild; but happy is he who keeps the law."*. Having a point of reference, often termed as a north star in business, helps team members stay aligned.   

> "Where there is no vision, the people perish." — *Proverbs 29:18*

A technology leader who is in a vision setting role has added complexity of disruptions in the very fabric of the industry as a whole.  Setting Vision will require persistence and direction.

Craig Groeschel accurately points out *"Vision is not just about where you're going—it's about who you're becoming."*  Your identity is more than reaching the pinnacle, it starts with the values and principles of how you get there.

## 2. Strategic Influencer: Translating Vision into Action

Goal alignment answers, "What do we want to achieve?"  Most companies have a constant internal battle here. In technology, it is about facilitating those priorities to be aligned between organizations.  The purse strings come from other places.

> "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower…" — *Luke 14:28*  
> "Write the vision; make it plain…" — *Habakkuk 2:2*

## 3. Resource Mappers: Allocating Tools, Time, and Talent

Resource mapping asks, "What do we need to get there?" Technology leadership always juggles the iron triangle of planning.  

**Biblical References**:  
> "To everything there is a season…" — *Ecclesiastes 3:1*  
> "Commit your works to the Lord…" — *Proverbs 16:3*

Technology decisions are never ideal. Usually their are constraints and leaders have to make hard choice.  I like what Timothy Keller wrote: *"Wise resource allocation reflects our trust in God's provision and timing."*  Leaders take leaps of faith, especially when elements are not in their control.

## 4. Risk Assessors: Identifying and Mitigating Threats

Risk assessment asks, "What could hinder us?" As a leader, do you have that trusted advisor that can be objective and detached when assessing risk.  Do you take that advice?  When you make big decisions, are you taking the time needed? 

> *"Foreseeing difficulties and preparing accordingly is a mark of wise leadership."* - John MacArthur

Many times it isn't just the financial risk technology leadrs are assessing. It may be the around ethical engagement in time, resources, and technology that we have to be conscious of. Russell Moore: *"Anticipate moral and societal challenges and respond with biblical integrity."*

## 5. Cadence Coordinators: Maintaining Rhythm and Accountability

Cadence coordination ensures consistent progress through structured rhythms. This is the lifeblood of technology systems, where 1's and 0's drive to stable results.  

> *"Daily disciplines and weekly rhythms foster spiritual and professional growth."* - Craig Groeschel


Technology leaders must look diligently at the systems and processes that are built so that there isn't drift or churn.  Efficiencies are not found through building more software, but rather focusing on people and their processes first.



## Reflection:

Take a moment to reflect on your current role in strategic planning—whether as a visionary, planner, resource steward, risk assessor, or cadence coordinator.

1. **Which of the five roles do you most identify with in your current work? Why?**
2. **Consider the voices that influence your planning—mentors, pastors, authors. How can you incorporate more spiritually grounded counsel into your leadership journey?**

> *"Commit your works to the Lord, and your plans will be established." — Proverbs 16:3*
