Strategic planning in technology leadership is not just a matter of metrics and milestones. Technology leaders may have one or more roles when engaged. How we lead has far reaching impact when working through strategy.  Consider how these roles influence, direct, and engage our stewardship.

### Vision Setters: Defining Direction and Purpose

Vision setters asks, "Where are we headed?" It aligns every action with the mission and values of the organization. Usually this question is only asked frequently by a few. It shouldn't change drastically, and the answer should be communicated to those that are following the leader. Having a point of reference, often termed as a north star in business, helps team members stay aligned.

> *"Where there is no revelation of God's will, people run wild; but happy is he who keeps the law."* Matthew Henry

and

> "Where there is no vision, the people perish." — *Proverbs 29:18*

A technology leader who is in a vision setting role has added complexity of disruptions in the very fabric of the industry as a whole.  Setting Vision will require persistence and direction.

Craig Groeschel accurately points out: 

> *"Vision is not just about where you're going — it's about who you're becoming."*  

Your identity is more than reaching the pinnacle, it starts with the values and principles of how you get there.  Leaders need to start with the inward motivation when projecting vision.

### Strategic Influencer: Translating Vision into Action

An influencer asks "What do we want to achieve?" In technology, forward progress is achieved through facilitating alignment of  priorities as a foundation.

> "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower…" — *Luke 14:28*

> "Write the vision; make it plain…" — *Habakkuk 2:2*

Here are 3 traits of influencer roles that impact strategic planning:

* Speaking Truth in Love - Sometimes hard messages need to be conveyed to guide and direct strategy.  An influencer can articulate that message in a way that lands well, even if it is uncomfortable to here.

* Listening Well – Being quick to listen and slow to speak is foundational to peacemaking and wise leadership. Nehemiah and Joseph are examples of leaders who used discernment and restraint to influence outcomes.

* Getting to Decisions – The counsel of an influencer is geared to come to an outcome.  They help to bridge the gap with wisdom, experience, and peace making.

### Resource Mappers: Allocating Tools, Time, and Talent

Resource mappers ask "What do we need to get there?" Technology leadership always juggles the iron triangle of planning.  

> *"Wise resource allocation reflects our trust in God's provision and timing."* - Timothy Keller  

Strategic planning outcomes always have unknowns. Knowing what your resources are makes it easier, but they are not full proof. The most important gap that this role fulfills is providing the visual representation of the cost. Culmination of this role's work can effectively change prioritization and direction in the strategic plan. 


### Risk Assessors: Identifying and Mitigating Threats

Risk assessment asks, "What could hinder us?" As a leader, do you have that trusted advisor that can be objective and detached when assessing risk.  Do you take that advice?  When you make big decisions, are you taking the time needed? 

> *"Foreseeing difficulties and preparing accordingly is a mark of wise leadership."* - John MacArthur

Many times it isn't just the financial risk technology leaders are assessing. It may be the around ethical engagement in time, resources, and technology that we have to be conscious of. 

> *"Anticipate moral and societal challenges and respond with biblical integrity."* - Russell Moore

In strategic planning this role grounds a business by challenging idealistic plans and happy path thinking.

### Cadence Coordinators: Maintaining Rhythm and Accountability

Cadence coordinators ask "How do we execute efficiently?" They ensure consistent progress through structured rhythms. This is the lifeblood of technology systems, where 1's and 0's drive to stable results.  

> *"Daily disciplines and weekly rhythms foster spiritual and professional growth."* - Craig Groeschel


Technology leaders must look diligently at the systems and processes that are built so that there isn't drift or churn.  Efficiencies are not found through building more software, but rather focusing on people and their processes first.


## Reflection:

Take a moment to reflect on your current role in strategic planning—whether as a visionary, planner, resource steward, risk assessor, or cadence coordinator.

1. Which of the five roles do you most identify with in your current work? Why?

2. Consider the voices that influence your planning—mentors, pastors, authors. How can you incorporate more spiritually grounded counsel into your leadership journey?

> *"Commit your works to the Lord, and your plans will be established." — Proverbs 16:3*
