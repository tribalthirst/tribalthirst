My life is "under construction".  Hopefully, I am building on a foundation.  Even that foundation should be built on the sediment layers of our past experiences.  Each decade, year, or week might need a touchup or remodel.  Hopefully, it doesn't require a full teardown.

We shape who we are by the way we construct each moment.  At 8 was your vision to be an astronaut, a ballerina, the worlds greatest hip-hop artist? How about your 20 year old self or even the young age of 50?  When you look back, do you see how the architecture has shifted or modified from the original?

Where ever you are landing today, it is the perfect place to build on for tomorrow.  Make your building materials ones of substance.  

I want to be built on that sediment rock with beams and pillars of:
* integrity
* grace
* mercy

I want glass windows of:
* transparency
* trust
* vulnerability

Last, I want continuous light to shine.  I won't hide it behind shades so that only I can enjoy it.  

My construction will take a lifetime.  Some pieces will not be finished. Areas may have gaps and be ugly. I will embrace and work to turn those crevices of ugliness into a part of the masterpiece by doing better.
