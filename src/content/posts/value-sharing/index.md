{{<featuredimage>}}Learn from a great Wisdom book - Ecclesiastes{{</featuredimage>}}

We all have something to share.  But why do we share?  Is it to be recognized?  Is it so that others can benefit?  Is it to achieve and objective or to draw others in?  Is it to influence (either good or bad)?  Maybe it is just to shout out into the wide internet and hope someone hears.

It doesn't matter what your reason is, it is yours.  A few things to keep in mind:
* Someone else might find what you share valuable.  
* Someone may become informed.  
* Someone might hear your shout and respond. 

We have all been given a mind that can ponder simple or hard questions.  We are able to glean new insights on old ideas.  When we gain knowledge and understanding, wisdom is soon to follow.  Share that wisdom.  That is what #valuesharing is all about.
