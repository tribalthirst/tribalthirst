I collect these posts from various different sources throughout the week. They my be on a variety of topics and my raw notes about them are included.  The vision for weekly shares is so that others can find value in one or more.  Even if you don't, check back next week for a different set.

## [AI and normalizing good enough](https://ayende.com/blog/202371-B/ai-impact-normalizing-good-enough)

### Author: Oren Eini

 I was just reading a transcript of a podcast that had a few transcription errors about 30 minutes before reading this post. For years, I have thought we are on a race to the bottom in terms of the quality expected from software and applications. It reminds me that I always need to be aware of my good enough bar.

 ## [Don't be a Ghost Developer](https://seankilleen.com/2025/01/how-to-be-a-ghostbuster/)

### Author: Sean Killeen

 I really like some of the thoughts around engaging your developers and engineers on the team. Measurements are necessary, but they don't tell the whole story. How are you as a leader keeping a pulse of your team. Could ghosting if it could be as true as 10% be driving many companies to back to the office??

 ## [DORA and the 4 Metrics](https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/)

### Author: Nathan Harvey

 Start somewhere at least to get a handle on how well your software engineering practices are doing. And please try to measure the right things.

 ## [Git Aliases from 2014 ](https://haacked.com/archive/2014/07/28/github-flow-aliases/)

### Author: Phil Haack

 I have my own set of GIT aliases. I have some custom workflows. I don't code as much anymore, but I am definitely going to review this list and liberally extract some to my local alias list.

 ## [Learn to Learn](https://msicc.net/2025-03-03-Learning-techniques-you-should-know/)

### Author: Marco Siccardi

 It was a good reminder for me to continue to innovate in how I try to learn. Lately it has been through randomization of topics. Then I pick up one that strikes my interest and just explore more in depth.

 ## [Let's Talk Metrics](https://blog.nordcraft.com/does-ai-really-make-you-more-productive)

### Author: Salma

 Salma is highlighting a discussion around metrics with AI. I am curious if there are studies on this and how is code quality improving or decreasing. Anecdotal tells me quality is going downhill at a fast rate. But I am just an engineer who doesn't code much anymore.

 ## [Multiple Profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles)

### Author: Microsoft

 Ok. The fact that these profiles can be imported and exported has me thinking. It also has me wondering "Do I really need to have multiple profiles"? Then I read this article and based upon my work context, I can definitely say yes.

 ## [Places to Donate Books](https://bemorewithless.com/places-to-donate-books/)

### Author: Tammy Stroebel

 i was just talking to my wife about all the books we had and what to do with them. I am reading this on #worldbookday. Some great ideas that I never knew.

 ## [Strategy / Execution / Pull Not Push](https://jdmeier.com/strategy-vs-execution/)

### Author: J.D. Meier

 This is actually a mini-series by J.D. that really highlights many companies challenges in planning when the opportunity has past. Being in some big annual, six-month, and quarterly exercises, I don't think one of them hit the mark in terms of even 75% accuracy. I think that there is a though in there about trying the same failed thing over and over. Check out the other 2 in the series: https://jdmeier.com/from-push-to-pull-strategy/ and https://jdmeier.com/from-push-to-pull/

 ## [What AI Camp are you in?](https://apievangelist.com/2025/04/25/you-are-not-taken-seriously-if-you-are-not-doing-or-talking-about-artificial-intellgence/)

### Author: 

 The API Evangelist produced this thought provoking post about the pressures to jump on the AI bus. I get caught up in the hype many times, and it is important to take that step back and evaluate what we believe. One thing I totally agree with is people need to be front and center of any conversation when it comes to advancing "progress".

 ## [When applications demand all the attention](https://apievangelist.com/2025/04/21/when-applications-demand-all-the-attention/)

### Author: Kin Lane - API Evangelist

 Squirrel! Shiny new things for racoons! This post reminds me of how not to develop systems. Right now, someone's boss is demanding AI integration. It will cause deviations from the architecture, strategy, and long-term viability of the product, but we have AI integration. Squirrel! Let's auto generate images for our Brand next. Squirrel!
