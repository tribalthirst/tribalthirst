Something must be wrong with my RSS feed program.  At least that is what I thought.  It turns out that a blog that posts every weekday consistently was taking a vacation.  He posted a note on the home page probably for people like me.

Consistency creates a feeling of stability.  We rely on the timing, efficacy, and strong associations of things that are consistent:

* The train schedule
* The calendar 
* Maybe a paycheck
* Even an election

We have an opportunity to build consistent patterns in our lives. Here are some thoughts around how some of my life repeatable patterns benefit others (results may vary):

* Building Trust - I can be counted on because I have shown that I am dependable with an area of my life.
* Efficiency - Others can be more efficient because they know the outcome
* Safety - When a repeatable condition is well understood, people will feel safe in the boundaries.  

I strive to be a person of consistency, especially for my family, friends, co-workers, and greater community.  To achieve that I need to have a well grounded vision of who I am striving to become.
