## [Coaching](https://jdmeier.com/what-is-coaching/)

### Author: 

 I reached out to J.D. one day, when I worked at Microsoft. I had read a blog post by someone else about looking for a coach. Fortunately, good advice prepared me well for an informational. 30 minutes turned into an hour plus of gaining wisdom. If you don't have a coach or mentor, learn about coaching here. There are like 3 or 4 more posts also, where J.D. freely shares knowledge. Definitely stuff to learn from a proven strategic leader.

 ## [GIT Range Diffs](https://andrewlock.net/verifiying-tricky-git-rebases-with-range-diffs/)

### Author: Andrew Lock

 I don't do as much coding now as I used to. However, I think this might be worth trying to do as a practice just to be sure of my rebase actions. I wonder if I can add it into my check-in/commit dance.

 ## [GitHub Gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

### Author: GitHub Docs

 A simple overview of creating Gists. I was having a conversation with several engineers who have never had heard of Gists, so I thought I would go get a good tutorial link. Bitbucket has a "similar" feature with snippets.

 ## [Managing PMs - Let's understand the role first](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2025/04/managing-pms/)

### Author: Eric Brechner

 I love Eric here. He puts in effort every month to bring out thoughtful content. This time is no different. I was also just having a debate on whether PMs are useful or a waste. Great ones are game changers, because of the value they add reducing friction and getting the right answers.

 ## [Nothing](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/editorials/having-no-idea-where-to-start/)

### Author: Louis Davidson

 I feel this way a lot. I get blocked, mentally, physically, sometimes emotionally and just stare. How to get started is key. Need to listen to the song by The Who...

 ## [Preserving our library system](https://blog.archive.org/2025/04/07/vanishing-culture-preserving-the-library-system/)

### Author: Brewster Kahle

 Oh wow. WE need more of this kind of writing. It hurt my heart to think about this point of view to preserve our libraries. Preserving knowledge should be a noble and worthwhile endeavor for our future generations. That means saving the good, bad, and ugly content from our opinions. Is this disappearing in the age of AI, Paywalls, and proprietary nonsense.
