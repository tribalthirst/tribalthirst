One day after my grandma passed away, I was given some old notes that she wrote.  I place high value on those writings to the point where they have been photocopied, transcribed, and saved in multiple places.  To most people, those papers would be insignificant, but to me they held value.  I can almost hear my grandma's voice as I read them from time to time.

Value is the assignment of worth.  Many times it is based upon a monetary association, others as a scale of recognition that is applied.  Part of my job one time was to build extrinsic and intrinsic value for our customers.   Intrinsic value always gave me the most satisfaction.

## Assigning value to people

Stop! Don't even go there!

Ethically and morally this is something that breaks my heart.  We see it with some pharmaceutical companies, estimating the amount of "acceptable loss" at clinical trials.  Many insurance companies work to squeeze every penny from mortality rate tables.  It is a science to them.

- The Psalmist tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made ([Psalm 139:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+139%3A14&version=ESV))
- Throughout the bible, value was placed on the people not the possessions. Every person matters.
- Jesus paid the ultimate price for our souls, dying on the cross.

We truly don't know how we will add value in the next second, minute, day, or year to others.  Value is multiplied in others when we spread love, kindness, and joy in the world.
