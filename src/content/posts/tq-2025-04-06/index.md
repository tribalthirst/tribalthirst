## [API Governance: What does that mean](https://apievangelist.com/2025/04/02/what-is-it-you-are-governing-when-you-say-api-governance/)

### Author: Kin Lane

 I really liked this as a small thought-provoking exercise. As I get older, I am asking for more definitions in everyday conversations. The key takeaway for me on this one was leadership only willing to govern one area, but not the whole. Sounds a lot like most software engineering where there are segregated roles.

 ## [Codegen workflows](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/)

### Author: Harper Reed

 Martin Fowler boosted this on Mastodon so I took a peek. I am glad I did. I am really starting to see how using LLMs for design becomes a game changer.

 ## [CORS - Dangers of a bad Implementation](https://github.blog/security/application-security/localhost-dangers-cors-and-dns-rebinding/)

### Author: Kevin Stubbings

 This post has a great overview, with some real-world examples of implementations that can create vulnerabilities. CORS is complex and needs extra development time to be factored in for testing in my opinion. I was thinking what a painful test experience here. Must be some articles to research later for good testing.

 ## [Extract Method: I'd rather read 50 lines of code](https://codeopinion.com/id-rather-read-50-lines-than-extract-method-refactoring/)

### Author: Derek Comartin

 This caught my attention because I am a fan of readable source code. 50 lines in a method drives me nuts. The video should create some aha moments for many developers. Especially when it comes to returning from functions that the extract method refactoring hides sometimes.

 ## [Hanselminutes: Tiny Experiments](https://www.hanselminutes.com/991/tiny-experiments-with-anne-laure-le-cunff)

### Author: Scott Hanselman, Anne-Laure Le Cunff

 I am buying Tiny Experiments after this podcast. I have had several places in my reading, research, leisure that has talked about "purpose". Manufactured content with a leaderboard is not where I want to be. It is time to break free from that. Create something useful than scroll. Anne-Laure talks about my "valuesharing" mindset.

 ## [Leadership Lessons from 60 ](https://careynieuwhof.com/leadership-lessons-from-60/)

### Author: 

 This is a great list to 10 nuggets, I wish I had known as a younger leader. Really love the bit about learning from Wisdom before you have to learn from Pain. Character matters for your legacy.

 ## [Observability is everyone's job](https://thenewstack.io/observability-every-engineers-job-not-just-ops-problem/)

### Author: Martin Thwaites

 I appreciate this, as it is one area of engineering that is usually sub par for many teams. The non-negotiables for code should include this and there is a real good list of other necessary skills / disciplines.

 ## [Paralyzed - Functional Freeze](https://nesslabs.com/functional-freeze)

### Author: 

 I have felt this way for a pretty long season. The last two weeks I have really reflected on some small changes to get out of this freeze

 ## [Semantic Telemetry](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/semantic-telemetry/)

### Author: Microsoft Research

 I need to spend a lot more time just thinking about this topic. There is so much detail here and I think this will be a fascinating project to understand user behavior with AI Models. The statement of move from deterministic to probability based telemetry is fascinating. I am only about 85% sure I got this right :)

 ## [Starbucks Scalability For Developers](https://particular.net/blog/what-starbucks-can-teach-us-about-software-scalability)

### Author: Weronika ≈Åabaj

 This is a great post that was back in 2016, talking about scalability in a business context. The principles of knowing what is important, and concurrency from the start make this a great read. Key: If someone takes your coffee, it isn't the end of the world. I am sure you will get another one.
