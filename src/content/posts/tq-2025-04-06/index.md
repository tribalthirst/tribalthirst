## [API Governance: What does that mean](https://apievangelist.com/2025/04/02/what-is-it-you-are-governing-when-you-say-api-governance/)

### Author: Kin Lane

 I really liked this as a small thought-provoking exercise. As I get older, I am asking for more definitions in everyday conversations. The key takeaway for me on this one was leadership only willing to govern one area, but not the whole. Sounds a lot like most software engineering where there are segregated roles.

 ## [Codegen workflows](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/)

### Author: Harper Reed

 Martin Fowler boosted this on Mastodon so I took a peek. I am glad I did. I am really starting to see how using LLMs for design becomes a game changer.

 ## [CORS - Dangers of a bad Implementation](https://github.blog/security/application-security/localhost-dangers-cors-and-dns-rebinding/)

### Author: Kevin Stubbings

 This post has a great overview, with some real-world examples of implementations that can create vulnerabilities. CORS is complex and needs extra development time to be factored in for testing in my opinion. I was thinking what a painful test experience here. Must be some articles to research later for good testing.

 ## [Extract Method: I'd rather read 50 lines of code](https://codeopinion.com/id-rather-read-50-lines-than-extract-method-refactoring/)

### Author: Derek Comartin

 This caught my attention because I am a fan of readable source code. 50 lines in a method drives me nuts. The video should create some aha moments for many developers. Especially when it comes to returning from functions that the extract method refactoring hides sometimes.

 ## [Hanselminutes: Tiny Experiments](https://www.hanselminutes.com/991/tiny-experiments-with-anne-laure-le-cunff)

### Author: Scott Hanselman, Anne-Laure Le Cunff

 I am buying Tiny Experiments after this podcast. I have had several places in my reading, research, leisure that has talked about "purpose". Manufactured content with a leaderboard is not where I want to be. It is time to break free from that. Create something useful than scroll. Anne-Laure talks about my "valuesharing" mindset.

 ## [Leadership Lessons from 60 ](https://careynieuwhof.com/leadership-lessons-from-60/)

### Author: 

 This is a great list to 10 nuggets, I wish I had known as a younger leader. Really love the bit about learning from Wisdom before you have to learn from Pain. Character matters for your legacy.

 ## [Observability is everyone's job](https://thenewstack.io/observability-every-engineers-job-not-just-ops-problem/)

### Author: Martin Thwaites

 I appreciate this, as it is one area of engineering that is usually sub par for many teams. The non-negotiables for code should include this and there is a real good list of other necessary skills / disciplines.

 ## [Paralyzed - Functional Freeze](https://nesslabs.com/functional-freeze)

 I have felt this way for a pretty long season. The last two weeks I have really reflected on some small changes to get out of this freeze

 ## [Semantic Telemetry](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/semantic-telemetry/)

### Author: Microsoft Research

 I need to spend a lot more time just thinking about this topic. There is so much detail here and I think this will be a fascinating project to understand user behavior with AI Models. The statement of move from deterministic to probability based telemetry is fascinating. I am only about 85% sure I got this right :)

### Author: Weronika ≈Åabaj

 This is a great post that was back in 2016, talking about how scalability in a business context. The principles of knowing what is important, and concurrency from the start make this a great read. Key: If someone takes your coffee, it isn't the end of the world. I am sure you will get another one.

## [AI Coding Impacts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai.html#memo-13)

### Author: Martin Fowler

 This article has put into words what has been bothering me. Impacts of the code generated for maintainability. Like anything else, not everything is should just be taken at face value. It has been easier to tell when the code being written is generated. If you can't explain it, that may be a problem.

 ## [Christian Conversations with Unemployment Situations](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/spiritual-care-unemployed/)

### Author: Joe Carter

 I found this pretty helpful in that too often we have the superficial statements to people going through hardships. In today's world, we need to be open to deeper exploration and support to those who are facing employment challenges. I also especially liked how we need to change messages when teaching about success in God's Kingdom.

 Jesus' Words on the cross teach us about principles in leadership. I like how it starts with forgive them for they know not what they do. We will get hurt. How is our response.
