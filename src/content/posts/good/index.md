Today is recognized around the world as Good Friday! Sometimes we may be confused by why something would be considered good.

* Is it good for us?
* Is it good for others?
* Even though I don't see fruit yet, is the work good?

When in Japan a few weeks ago, there was a lot of excitement for the cherry blossom.  It has such beauty.  And then it falls off the tree.  Later it produces an amazing fruit.  That is goodness at many different levels.

* Some goodness is not visible to others
* Some goodness just shouts out
* Some goodness is just observing

I am intent on observing the goodness for what this day means to me.  Salvation!
