I am most likely on the second half of my timeline.Â  I am now feeling an urgency in my step to leave a legacy for others.

Whatever it is, I know a few things:<!--more-->

- It is all part of God's plan, not mine
- It won't be based upon the work I am currently doing
- It will be something fantastic

My character is being shaped to not just leave something behind for remembrance, but rather something that others can build upon.
