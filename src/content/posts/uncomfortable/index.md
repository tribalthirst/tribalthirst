Being uncomfortable gets my Spidey senses going. It is uncanny how I can see problems with much more clarity. The smallest details become chasms that I need to conquer or cross. Now combine being uncomfortable with new surroundings. <!--more-->It is like when Superman first discovers his superpowers of seeing everything blurring by and he can't take it all in till he focuses.

This is me now, with a new job and different environment. Here are steps I am taking for better clarity that may help you.

- Slow down. Not everything has to be solved right away.
- Find those who are comfortable already. Listen to what works for them. Be careful not to assimilate and look for opportunities to add value to their processes.
- Know the long term vision. Keep referring to it as you are doing day to day work. Remove the work that doesn't progress toward the vision.
- Embrace mistakes as valuable lessons.
- Be bold and courageous in your decision making.

Be comfortable with uncomfortable.
