The whole day went what I term as "whack-a-doodle" when a system issue raged at 4am.  The disruption rippled into many people's day.  Identification, triage, mitigation, resolution, after action.  The residual affects may last for days. <!--more-->

What I thought I was going to get done in a nice orderly fashion never materialized.  I missed a post, ate breakfast around 11am, and worked at catching the tail of the "red tape" of an incident. My day has now been exhausted.

In life, these situations will occur, often at the most "inconvient" times.  Our attitude drives how well we come out of the fray.  It also is a reminder that there will be trials to persevere through.  

The biggest question is:  Did we grow from the experience?  If we can say yes, then I would say take it as a win.
