We know that media consumes time.  On average, people worldwide spend 143 minutes per day on media (social, tv, etc). That adds up to 52,195 minutes per year, or about 870 hours. <!--more-->

Let's see how that will translate if that time was spent reading books:
- If the average book is 300 pages 
  - 60 pages per hour translates to 174 books per year!
  - 30 pages per hour is about 87 books!
  - 15 pages per hour is around 45 books! 

I try to read about 15 to 30 minutes each day before I go to bed.  I read books, blogs, magazines, and technical information. Some weekends I can go for a half a day engrossed in a book.  Sometimes I even have as many as 4 or 5 books going at one time.

I read books to relax, for research, self-improvement, and for work. At one time that was all I had.  No web pages, cell phones, videos to scroll through.  Not that these media types are all bad, but they just didn't exist.

Being literate has had a big impact on gaining employment, adding value to family, friends and companies.  Literacy should be a human right.  I was shocked to see (1 in 10 people)[https://ourworldindata.org/literacy] around the world are still considered illiterate.

Books are an intricate part of my world.  How are they part of yours?
