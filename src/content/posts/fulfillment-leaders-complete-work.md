I have now been working about 6 hours today.  I wish I could say it is for enjoyment, but rather I am trying to fulfill a work commitment.  Sometimes it takes extra effort, persevering through frustration, or just time to complete.  Fulfillment is that finality of completion, the realization of a achieving a goal, or getting to the end.  Leaders take fulfillment very seriously, both for themselves and their subordinates.  In order to complete work, here are two key leadership behaviors:

## Delegation

One of the most effective ways that work gets accomplished is through delegation.  This is the way for a leader to scale their output and work.

- Jesus delegated spreading the Gospel to his followers ([Matthew 10:5-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10&version=ESV))
- Paul entrusts those that hear the Gospel to teach others ([2 Timothy 2:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+2%3A2&version=ESV))
- Moses used delegation for passing judgement so that he could spend time to others ([Exodus 18:13-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+18%3A13-26&version=ESV))

## Decision Making

When leaders are truly committed to fulfilling goals, projects, or solving problems, they aren't afraid to make or withhold a decision.

- Leaders make decisions to move things forward, but not at the expense of compromising values or principles
- Leaders withhold decisions to allow buy-in for others who will do the majority of the work
- Leaders make decisions where they shoulder the burden, relieving pressure on others getting the work done.

Fulfillment is about completing work.  I like this word, because it speaks to the finality and fullness of a job well done.  Leaders respect and honor fulfillment from others and expect it of themselves.
