Let’s get real: the myth of the lone genius is dead. In the world of technology, the best leaders aren’t the ones holed up in corner offices, clutching their secrets. They’re the ones in the trenches, learning, failing, and growing—together. If you’re a tech leader, here’s the truth: community isn’t just nice to have. It’s your secret weapon. <!--more-->

And guess what? The Bible’s been preaching this for centuries. Let’s break down three game-changing benefits of learning in community, with a little help from some ancient wisdom.

## Sharpened Wisdom: Diverse Minds, Better Ideas
Remember Jesus and the disciples? They didn't just sit around nodding politely. They debated, questioned, and sometimes flat-out disagreed ([Matthew 16:13–20](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.16.13-20.NKJV)).

That friction? It’s where the magic happens.

In tech, you want people who challenge your assumptions. You want 
* the engineer who asks “why,” 
* the designer who says “what if,” 
* the product manager who says "what's next," as they pokes hole in your roadmap 
    
Community learning means your ideas get stress-tested, refined, and—sometimes—completely reimagined. Iron sharpens iron, and wisdom gains a foothold in your culture of excellence.  We have to be okay with the questioning mindset.  The challenge will be to start the learning as far in front of the process as possible.

* A software engineer needs to explore the requirement and not just take it as face value.
* The designer needs to constantly sit in the customer driver seat to gain process flow insights
* Product managers need to be 4 steps ahead in the roadmap


## Strengthened Character: Accountability Is Everything
Let's talk about the elephant in the room.  It is getting increasingly more difficult in the workplace to have conversations on accountability.  Feelings may be hurt.  Issues are swept under the rug to be surfaced at a later date.  There is an over indexing for political correctness.  

* Can accountability conversations be awkward? Sure.
* Could the starter of these dialogs face blowback?  Probably.
* Are these conversations necessary? Absolutely. 
    
Tech leaders need accountability partners—people who’ll tell you when your attitude sucks, provide constructive feedback on poor quality code,  or inform you that strategy’s off. Community keeps you honest. 

It’s easy to drift when you’re solo; it’s hard to hide when you’re surrounded by people who care enough to call you out. That’s how character gets built. That’s how leaders stay grounded.

A great example of accountability is in the parable of the talents ([Matthew 25:14-30](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.25.14-30.NKJV)).  Each person is responsible for taking the opportunities given to them and making the most out of them.  Don't go alone, because, if you do, you may be burying dividends.

## Empowered Multiplication: Teach, Equip, Repeat
Jesus didn't just teach—He equipped His disciples to go out and lead ([Matthew 28:19–20](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.28.19-20.NKJV)). Paul mentored Timothy, who mentored others ([2 Timothy 2:2](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/2TI.2.2.NKJV)). Leadership wasn’t about hoarding knowledge; it was about multiplying it. 

In tech, the leaders who learn with their teams create a ripple effect. They model curiosity, share what they know, and empower others to step up. The result? A culture where everyone grows, and the impact multiplies. You’re not just building products—you’re building people.

* If you aren't mentoring - Start.
* If you aren't creating space for growth - Get out of the way.
* If you aren't providing the tools needed for the job - Invest.

## Bottom Line: Community Is Your Competitive Edge
If you’re leading in tech, don’t settle for echo chambers or solo flights. Build your tribe. Invite the tough conversations. Share the journey. The Bible’s wisdom is clear: iron sharpens iron. In the digital age, the leaders who learn together win together.

Ready to sharpen up? Grab your team, start the dialogue, and watch your leadership (and your impact) multiply.
