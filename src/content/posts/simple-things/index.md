In my mind, simplicity can be a very hard thing to achieve. Writing this post is a great example.  I am thinking about all of the "pre-work or pre-thought" that I must do for the post to be successful.  My problem is I didn't determine success or have a grandiose idea of what that would look like.  [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/) has been blogging for years.  He has built knowledge and wisdom through short posts.  

* Are they all masterpieces? Doesn't matter.
* Are they grouped in logical ways?  Sometimes.
* Are the posts consistent?  Pretty much.

I learned from his insights.  I gained some different thought processes.  I even found myself smiling after many of them.

Maybe it is my time to start.
