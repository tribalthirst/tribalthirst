We can't get away from prioritization. My time to write this post is based upon my time prioritization, for instance.  

We prioritize based upon:

* Data - Prioritizing next steps based upon the data that we analyze
* Emotions - How we feel determines priority.
* Directed - This is out of our control.  Companies that we work for for instance, establish priority that their employees work on.

When we think about priority, let's remember the following:

1. When we say yes to one priority, we push other priorities down
2. There is only one top priority.  There may be buckets of priority in terms of categorization, but only 1 priority.
3. We need clarity in our direction, strategies, and values in order to prioritize effectively.
