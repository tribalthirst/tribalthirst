99% of my days are usually positive.  However, I don't consider myself a positive person.  Sometimes I even consider myself a curmudgeon on the world's stage.  My mindset is fixated on the problem space so that they can be solved.  Ok maybe only 95% of my day is positive.  

## I like Positive over Negative
When I am in an postive environment, time flies.  I remember the good things, the memorable moments, and the joyous laughter longer than the snarky comment, frown, or funky attitude.  People with positive attitudes are infectious, even the colors that they wear bring out joy.  

> Your attitude is like a box of crayons that color your world. Constantly color your picture gray, and your picture will always be bleak. Try adding some bright colors to the picture by including humor, and your picture begins to lighten up." 
>
> â€“ Allen Klein

Books are written about thinking positively.  Studies have shown that a positive attitude is good for your health.  When I have an optimistic outlook toward the future, I am more likely to embrace any hardships with a better attitude.

So throw that percent of your day of negative out the window of your mind and embrace on the joy of postive moments.
