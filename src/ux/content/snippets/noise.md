Sometimes in order to get clarity of purpose, you have to figure out how to filter out the noise of life from the information that matters.  I think below is a best practice to follow:

## Step 1 - Discover what's hidden

This may seem counter-intuitive, but it may be important to actually open the floodgates of noise into a centralized bucket of information.  I know of projects, where "informational" data was suppressed only to find out it is really important. Take an assessment of what has already been turned off and understand why it has been. It could be that the information is truly not needed.  If so leave it, but you will know that it has intentionally been stopped.

## Step 2 - Get specific signals

Most times the noise is valuable "supporting" information.  There is usually a way to "Alert" for specific activity to happen based upon that data.  Create the alert, link supporting information for reference and remove it from the bucket of noise.  I tend to think of these signals as smoke detectors in the house.  When one goes off, I truly need to take action.  The location gives me the supporting evidence I need.

## Step 3 - Automate and / or delegate

My best automations are the ones that remove the noise completely once it is determined it isn't needed.  It may be the email that comes in every day at 9am for a development system.  This is automatic circular file cabinet fodder.  I also like assigning noise for others to work on where possible.  If I am wasting time on low value work, it is noise that keeps me from being more productive
