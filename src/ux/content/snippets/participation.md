> Romans 12:4 - "For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function."

All of us are part of a team, whether it is your family, work, or an extracurricular activity.  As part of a team we are expected to participate.  I am starting to understand the values of participating at the right level.  Here are some challenges when we don't participate correctly.

- We may over function for someone else.
- We may cause other people to have to over function to make up for our lack of participation.
- We may wear down before our time.
- We may become discouraged, frustrated, or complacent in our roles
- A lack of participation will cause gaps for the team and shows signs of immaturity, both of the individual and the team.

My wish is to be a correctly participating individual using the Grace of God to give me balance.
