Probably the biggest battle I fight is one of perception with other people.  Why is this a battle? Mostly because I let my selfish side take over my actions, instead of being mindful of how my actions affect others.  I make excuses about this behavior to appease my ego, pride, and sense of accomplishment.  No excuses justify my actions of self-preservation.  I need to rely on the Creator to give me grace and mercy when I fail.

>Those who never read the Bible will read our lives, so it is by doing good that we put to silence the ignorance of foolish men - David Guzik ([1 Peter 2 Commentary](https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/guz/1-peter-2.html))

I heard this quote in Sunday's sermon and spent some time in introspection.  Working with teams, coaching and mentoring, I often talk about the value of introspection.  As Christians, this is a habit that we must cultivate for several reasons:

1. People see how we behave every day.  We are representatives of the Kingdom.  If we live "ordinary" and "worldly" lives, the witness does not match our faith.  Remember one day ordinary will be eternity in heaven worshipping our Lord.
2. I look backwards to understand how I can create opportunities to share Christ's love through me going forward.
3. As Christians, if we are growing, we are changing.  Change brings about character through perseverance, especially during struggles.  Look back on the struggle and share the lessons of maturing in Christ.
4. Are you lukewarm? Who would people rather hang around with, the milk toast or the magnet. Christians are a [peculiar people](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A9&version=KJV).  I have gone from being a person might only give a passing comment so as not to be looked at funny to being a fan of my Master interjecting the good news intentionally in my actions.  I am finding that the differing attitudes, principles, and foundation in Christ draws people near.

I am excited to see other people now looking at me differently.  I am not ashamed of being gracious, loving, caring, humble, meek and having a servant's heart.  The perception is changing and it is on the right path.  My hope is that people see Christ in me so that they can also establish an eternal relationship.
