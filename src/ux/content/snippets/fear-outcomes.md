Today on a podcast of [Design Matters,](http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters/seth-godin-2/)  [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) was talking about the reason so many people are blocked from moving forward is because of fear.  I started thinking about the fear in my life and how it is very selfish and created because I want people to have a certain perception of me.  Going a little deeper, I believe there actually two outcomes of fear:

1. Fear of something creates a healthy reverence and respect.
2. Fear creates moments or even seasons of paralysis.

In the season of life I am in, I often see the second outcome, paralysis.  I fear changing my job role, stability for my family, not leaving a legacy for others, etc.  Then I realized as long I fear the Lord with whole hearted reverence and respect, I have the best advocate for helping me out of those moments when I am frozen in place by indecision, doubt, and selfishness.
