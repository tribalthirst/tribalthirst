This was a slide from 2014 talking about common project states.  I noticed I don't have any samples that are clean and crisp, with clarity.  Instead, I have:

- Fungus - Scope creep continuously adding on.
- Fire - Like most projects just trying to get it under control
- A maze of pipes - Can't you just feel the complexity trying to add something into the project?


What does your project state look like?
