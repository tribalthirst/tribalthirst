Today I thought I would focus on some productivity tools and tips I use with Outlook.

## [Wunderlist Add-In for Outlook](https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/wunderlist-for-outlook-add-in/)

I have taken an approach where my task list is separated from my email.  Wunderlist includes a great add-in that will turn any email into a task.  In addition, you can subscribe to your task list feed as a calendar list and see what tasks you said were going to be do on any day.

## [Quick Steps](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Automate-common-or-repetitive-tasks-with-Quick-Steps-A9CAF57E-0EB0-4B48-9141-A9904DA0AAF9?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US)

This is perhaps my favorite part of Outlook for productivity.  Quick steps enable me to quick do repetitive actions and assign them to shortcut keys. For example, I have a folder where I put reference emails.  The quick step has been configured to move the selected item to my "Reference" folder.  I then bind that quick step to CTL+SHFT+1 and voila, I can get through my inbox to zero real quick.

## [Mailbox Rules](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59)

Unlike quick steps, rules allow you to manage emails before you even see them in your inbox, or process after you send an email.  For instance, you can create a rule that delays sending by 1 minute.  I currently have over 20 rules that apply to my inbox before email even comes in.  My favorite:  Moving all of my meeting requests to a special folder for processing.
