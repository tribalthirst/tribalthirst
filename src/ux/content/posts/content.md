This morning I am not content.  I feel I am behind on work, blog posts, and my sleep last night was not peaceful.  I am more anxious than satisfied, more restless than at peace.  It is this type of morning where I focus to reflect on [God's mercies](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations+3&version=NIV) which are new every day.  My lack of contentment is self imposed.  All my needs are taken care of.

## Contentment is easy to find

Just make a list and start with the necessities. I am content because:

1. My family is in good health
2. I slept in a bed
3. I ate a great Thanksgiving potluck at the church last night
4. I have a job
5. I am loved
6. The Lord never gives us too much that we cannot bear it

I am now in a better place this morning with a changed heart.  I know that everything will work out for God's will.  My challenge is to seek after those things that are noble today.  To look forward to a glorious day with a satisfied soul.
