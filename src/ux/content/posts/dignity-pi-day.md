Dignity for me.  I want to be honored and respected.

Dignity for your neighbor.  They want to be honored and respected.<!--more-->

Student activism on gun control today is a demand for dignity to all students.  They are asking to be kept safe to learn.  They are not asking for everyone to let go of their 2nd amendment right, but rather to use some sense on having guns in schools.  True dignity for our neighbors is to value human life.

What if we could start a conversation vs. a walk out.  Maybe take your neighbor for a piece of lemon meringue for PI day and be empathetic to their heart.

I think a great step to understanding dignity is sharing that pie.
