The older I get, the less I relish instant gratification, acknowledgement, and self-promotion.<!--more-->

Maybe I just feel confident in my abilities (warning: pride setting in) or apathetic to false platitudes.

Could it be that it isn't that important anymore? The effort I put into promoting my work could be better spent elsewhere adding even more value. Surely this doesn't cross the line of arrogance or egocentric behavior.

Reality check:

1. We only promote work that seems sensational. Maybe that is why day to day operations work gets overlooked. Find a way to show that value through metrics and measurement.
2. We should promote work for awareness as our primary motivator.
3. Don't spend hours on slide decks, when you can sum it up in a few short sentences.
4. Realize promoting work is a tool to inform, enhance, and engage with your audience.
5. Be humble in the promotion. Give credit to others who came along side, influenced, and sweated over the work.
