Yesterday I was in a conversation about the cost of getting a specification to a "perfect" state.  I made a bold statement that most times perfection has too high of a cost and that I just need good enough. After stating that I started to consider what "good enough" really means.

## What is "Good Enough"

- Good enough has the appropriate quality that meets the needs of the task.  For NASA, it may be down to the micrometer
- Good enough enables the customer/individual to do the task with a high level of satisfaction that doesn't frustrate them
- Good enough drives higher throughput
- Good enough can be iterated on

## What Perfection Costs

- Time to market - Perfection may have you missing the train
- Stress - Perfection always has complications that add tension
- Strategic thinking - Perfection gets to deep tactical execution which distracts from strategic initiatives

Michael Hyatt just posted a fantastic article about "[Perfectionism](http://michaelhyatt.com/perfectionism.html "Perfectionism")" that covers a lot of this same theme.

John Maxwell has posted a couple of articles on the [10-80-10 rule.](http://www.johnmaxwell.com/blog/the-10-80-10-principle-the-key-to-maximizing-your-time-and-effort "10-80-10 Rule")
