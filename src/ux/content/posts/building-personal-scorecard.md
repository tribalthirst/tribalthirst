A local radio show this morning was having a conversation about using a scorecard for children's behavior for parents.  <!--more-->>Green mean that all criteria had been met, Yellow that a good attempt had taken place, and Red that it was probably a bad day for Johnny.  Each color had a rewards or consequences section.

I began to wonder if a scorecard would make a difference or help me to change a behavior pattern that I am not doing so well in.

- What would I measure?
- How would I measure it?
- Does it provide value?
- Who would see it?

I started looking around for example on the internet only to find that nothing satisfied me visually.  I believe this is because if I build a scorecard for myself it will be just that personal.  Here are some things I might track if I decide to do this:

- Self Empowerment - Am I learning and growing spiritually and keeping myself open and humble to affect all areas of my life?
- Family Values - What did I do today to deepen my commitment to my family?
- Work Effectiveness - Did the work I do today have impact on others?  If so how much?
- External Relationships - How am I investing in others to change the world?

As I start to build out that scorecard, I am seeing a lot of red.  Time to focus on the things that will make it green.
