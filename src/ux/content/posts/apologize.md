{{<featuredimage>}}A walk in Grand Coulee.  Apologies bring peace{{</featuredimage>}}
Over the past decade, I have seen a trend for political figures not to apologize at any cost.  Everyone makes mistakes.  It is impossible not to offend at times.  It is easy for words to be taken out of context.  So why don't our political leaders apologize when they have obviously wronged an individual or party?  It isn't just politicians, but business leaders also.  The best ones admit their mistakes and work diligently to correct the wrong.

## Apologies bring forgiveness

[Ephesians 4:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A32&version=ESV) Asks us to be kind to one another, forgiving, as God in Christ has forgiven us.  So, if someone comes up to you and apologizes, please forgive them.

- It allows a relationship to start healing
- It shows love and grace
- We would want someone to forgive us, if we apologized

## Apologize sincerely

When I need to apologize, I want to make sure that I am doing it with the correct heart.

1. I seek not to be angry when I apologize.
2. I watch how I apologize.  I don't want my words to seem sarcastic or nonchalant,
3. I don't expect forgiveness from those to whom I am apologizing (always working on this).
4. I understand that apologies may come with consequences for me.

God ask us to forgive and show love for our brothers and sisters.  He also expects us to apologize in humility as a witness of His love.  Do you need to apologize to someone today?
