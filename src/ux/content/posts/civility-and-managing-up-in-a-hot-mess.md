The first train of the day rolled by as I took a brisk walk to the coffee shop.  The podcasts were definitely aligned to stimulate my senses for the day on how to be a better employee in the small things.<!--more-->

How does one maintain civility in a work place that can be considered an attractive disaster (Andy Stanley rephrasing for a hot mess)?  It can be achieved by looking at the mess as a learning, serving, and growing mentality.  Be an observer of the mess, look at solutions, and help be proactive in the clean up with empathy and good will.

Managing up with solutions, a positive attitude, and kind words are much better than passive aggressive attitudes and a not my problem chip on the shoulder.
