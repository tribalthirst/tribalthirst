Two words, two letters, transformed by time with priceless meanings.

One is made manifest by the concrete actions, the other by essence.

Which proceeds before the other, 

Be then Do, 

or 

Do then Be. 

That my friends is the question.

...
 


We are beings defined by our Creator, not identities crafted by toil.

Extrinsic value from the world is based upon outcomes of do, 

The soul from every breath of being one and complete.

Head knowledge 

or 

Heart condition

One is a stepping stone to the other.

...



Be kind by doing nice things.

Be strong through courageous acts.

Be humble by holding up the mirror to every action you are aout to do.

Above all

Be Love

Doing everything in Love 

Which is the purpose for which we have been uniquely, fearfully, and wonderfully made
