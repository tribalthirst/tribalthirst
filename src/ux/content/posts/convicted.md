{{<featuredimage>}}Generosity brings smiles{{</featuredimage>}}
Today has been erratic, my heart was not at ease, and my behaviors and thoughts with each interaction have not been grace and mercy, but rather frustration and contempt.  <!--more-->That all changed when I saw a post in a Christian group in Yammer.  It was nothing grandiose, just asking to consider donating to a young woman's fight to go back to school in the fall.  I see many requests like this all the time.  There is always some cause, the pursuit of something greater, or even just a random kind act popping up on your radar frequently.  But today I was convicted to help and here is why:

- The cups of coffee I have in the morning can pay for my donation.
- This group of 50+ individuals can probably all afford a small donation, why not start the ball rolling.
- I needed to change my mental state for the day.
- 5 minutes is all it took to invest in a future

Is there someone you don't even know you can invest in.  It  doesn't have to be money, it can be:

- Time.  Find a way to give a person more time, they will be blessed by that in the end.
- Knowledge.  Be a mentor.  Share your experiences
- Attitude.  This can go a long ways to giving hope, charity, and grace to others.
