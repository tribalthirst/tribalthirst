What am I thankful for?  Why am I thankful?  Can I be thankful about unpleasant things in my life?  How do I show my thankfulness?  Here is one idea, make a list of what you are thankful for and update it every day.  Here is the start of my thankfulness list:

## What I am thankful for (the first five)

- I am thankful just to be alive today. God's mercies are new every day.  I can start each day with a fresh perspective to be better than I was yesterday, to make a difference.  I will show that by showing gratitude to others today.
- I am thankful for my family.  My wife, who is also my best friend, provides me with wisdom and insights.  My children make me smile with their thoughts, opinions, and energy.  I ask for favor to reciprocate back the love they have for me.
- I am thankful for my employment.  It keeps a roof over my head.  I have money coming in for all my necessities plus more.  I am trying to be thankful by going the extra mile at work, to deliver with quality and be committed.
- I am thankful for my health.  I am not taking any medicine and haven't had any major medical issues.  I must work to take care of my health more diligently.
- I am thankful to see the beauty of God's creation around me.  It is impossible to miss.  Wonders of sunsets, mountains, storms, and sunshine can all be in an afternoon.  May I show thankfulness by just taking the time to enjoy.

Now, these were 5 quick items I am thankful for.  I will continue to update those and add others.  Do this for a couple of weeks and then reflect.  I am thankful that you took the time to read this.  I hope that it will benefit you in the days to come.
