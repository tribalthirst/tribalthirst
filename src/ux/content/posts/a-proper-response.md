Having the right response to others makes collaboration much easier.

1. Is it constructive or destructive?
2. Is it positive or negative?
3. Is it selfish or selfless?
4. Is it based upon principle and values over compromise for short term gain?

Each interaction has the ability to be a one of a kind unique and edifying experience. Where there is thoughtfulness before the response, the outcome is usually one where both parties gain and not lose. A quick checklist to run down in your mind before answer could be:

- Am I responding according to principles and values?
- Am I adding to the conversation or other person?
- Is my focus on my fellow collaborator(s) instead of self-ego?
- What are the right words for me to use to deliver positivity?
